Why PhotonSpin
PhotonSpin targets three core needs for a modern PRNG:
- Speed: It must produce random data fast enough to keep up with modern workloads, from simulations to procedural generation.
- Scale: It should work well in vectorized and parallel environments, with a large internal state to support long-running streams.
- Quality: It must pass standard randomness tests and produce uniform, uncorrelated outputs across the full period.

The project centers on practical use. It emphasizes clean interfaces, clear documentation, and predictable performance characteristics. The design favors straightforward integration into existing pipelines, whether you run simulations, data analysis, or games.

Core ideas and goals
- Ultra-fast generation: The core loop uses a mix of fast integer operations, modular arithmetic, and lightweight mixing to maximize throughput on typical CPUs.
- Large period: PhotonSpin maintains a state that gives a long cycle before repeating. This helps avoid cycles in long-running simulations or procedural generation tasks.
- Statistical strength: The generator is designed to pass broad statistical tests that gauge randomness quality over large samples. It does not replace cryptographic randomness for security-critical tasks, but it aims to be robust for scientific and simulation workloads.
- Cross-platform operability: The implementation targets common architectures such as x86-64 and ARM, with clean abstractions that let you port to other platforms if needed.
- Easy integration: Clear API surfaces, concise examples, and language bindings make it easy to drop PhotonSpin into projects.

How PhotonSpin works
PhotonSpin uses a carefully designed internal state and a sequence of operations that mix, rotate, and update that state to produce 64-bit outputs. The high-level idea is:
- Maintain a multi-word internal state that is updated each step.
- Apply a mix function that combines the current state words with a set of derived values.
- Produce a 64-bit output by reading and mixing a subset of the internal state.

The exact details are guarded for portability and clarity, but the implementation emphasizes:
- Fast, branch-free code paths.
- SIMD-friendly data layouts when available.
- Deterministic behavior given the same seed.

Design and architecture
PhotonSpin is built with modularity in mind. The architecture centers on three layers:
- Core PRNG engine: Handles state updates and output generation. It is written to be branchless and cache-friendly.
- Platform adapters: Provide optimized paths for x86-64 with AVX2/AVX-512, ARM with NEON, and portable fallbacks for other architectures.
- API and bindings: Exposes a consistent C API, with wrapper bindings for Python, Rust, and Go. The API surface is stable to minimize churn for downstream projects.

State representation
- The internal state is a multi-word container, typically 256 bits or larger, designed to offer a long period and ample internal work per output.
- Each iteration updates the state via a few fused operations, reducing branching and memory traffic.
- The design aims to minimize correlation between successive outputs while maintaining high throughput.

Output generation
- The PRNG combines several sources from the state to form the next 64-bit value.
- A mixing step ensures that small changes in input seed lead to widely diverging outputs over time.
- Optional optional buffering can be used to partition work and improve memory locality in streaming scenarios.

Design goals in practice
- Predictable performance: Microbenchmarks show stable throughput across multiple runs and platforms.
- Deterministic seeding: Given the same seed, the generator produces the same sequence across runs and platforms, provided the same build.
- Reproducibility: For testing and simulations, the ability to reproduce results is essential.

Algorithms and math behind the generator
- Core mixing function: The mixing function is designed to spread entropy across the internal state while remaining fast.
- Bitwise operations: Shifts, rotates, xors, and simple arithmetic form the backbone of the work per output.
- Period considerations: The internal state structure is designed to avoid early repetition. The theoretical period is extremely large, well beyond practical use in most simulations.
- Seed handling: Seeding involves initializing the state with a seed value and an optional entropy input. The seed must be provided by the user to start the stream.

Verification and quality tests
- Statistical suites: PhotonSpin is tested with TestU01, Dieharder, and other mainstream suites. It passes standard batteries under typical configurations.
- Empirical testing: In-house tests check distribution uniformity, collision resistance in outputs, and cross-stream independence for multiple parallel generators.
- Long-run stability: Tests simulate long-running use to ensure that the period is effectively unnoticeable and that statistical properties remain stable over time.
- Reproducibility checks: Multiple independent runs with the same seed should yield identical sequences, confirming deterministic behavior.

Benchmarks and performance
- Benchmarks focus on throughput, latency, and CPU efficiency. They compare PhotonSpin to other fast PRNGs under representative workloads.
- Throughput: In vectorized mode on modern CPUs, photonspin can sustain tens of gigabytes per second of raw output in large-scale streams, depending on configuration and hardware.
- Latency: Per-output latency remains low, making it suitable for streaming random data in tight loops.
- Power efficiency: The design emphasizes reducing instruction count and memory traffic, which helps with power efficiency in long-running tasks.
- Comparisons to SHISHUA: In typical test scenarios, PhotonSpin demonstrates competitive or higher throughput with similar statistical strength. In some configurations, it reaches higher sustained throughput for long streams, while maintaining the same quality of the randomness.

Realistic caveats
- For cryptographic security: PhotonSpin focuses on statistical strength and performance for simulations and procedural generation. It is not a direct replacement for cryptographically secure RNGs where security guarantees are required.
- Hardware variability: Performance numbers vary with CPU generations, memory bandwidth, and compiler optimizations. Tuned builds on the target hardware deliver the best results.
- Long-running streams: When running for extremely long durations, monitor state usage and consider optional reseeding strategies if your application requires it.

Benchmarks: sample scenarios
- Scenario A: Monte Carlo simulation on a tight loop
  - Target: 64-bit outputs, streaming in a tight loop
  - Observed: High throughput with low latency; minimal branches; consistent outputs across iterations
- Scenario B: Large-scale procedural generation
  - Target: Parallel streams across multiple workers
  - Observed: Strong independence properties across streams; no visible correlations
- Scenario C: Scientific computing pipeline
  - Target: Random matrices and vectors
  - Observed: Uniform distribution properties; robust behavior under repeated sampling

Quick start: build and run
Prerequisites
- A modern C/C++ compiler toolchain (gcc, clang, or MSVC)
- CMake for cross-platform builds
- Optional: Python for bindings, Rust for additional bindings, or Go if you need language integration

Build steps (Linux/macOS)
- Clone the repository
- Create a build directory
- Run cmake and build
- Run tests and benchmarks

Example commands
- cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

- cmake --build build --target bench

Usage example (C API)
- Initialize:
  - photonspin_seed(&state, seed_value);
  - photonspin_init(&state, seed_value, entropy_ptr, entropy_len);
- Generate a 64-bit value:
  - uint64_t x = photonspin_next64(&state);
- Generate a stream:
  - for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) { uint64_t v = photonspin_next64(&state); /* use v */ }

Seed and entropy
- Seed selection: Use a high-entropy seed from an OS source or a hardware RNG when available.
- Entropy input: You can mix external entropy into the seed initialization to increase diversity between runs.
- Reproducibility: For reproducible experiments, fix the seed and entropy consistently across runs.

Language bindings and integrations
- Python: A thin wrapper exposes a Pythonic interface around the C API. It supports generator objects and direct sampling APIs.
- Rust: A safe wrapper provides a Rust-friendly API, with Iterator implementations for streaming random numbers.
- Go: A Go package offers a straightforward bridge to the underlying C API, enabling easy usage in Go projects.
- Other languages: The C API makes it possible to implement bindings for other languages as needed.

API surface: what you get
- photonspin_seed/state: Initialize the generator with a seed.
- photonspin_init/state, entropy: Optional advanced initialization for entropy.

Integrations and best practices
- Use a fresh seed for new independent streams to avoid correlation between streams.
- In parallel workloads, allocate a separate PhotonSpin state per thread to minimize contention.
- Use a streaming approach if you generate large data sets, to reduce memory churn.
- For reproducible results, fix seeds and avoid non-deterministic entropy sources in the pipeline.
